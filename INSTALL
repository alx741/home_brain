INSTALL
=======

CLI
===

$ make


WBI
===

-Install apache server with php interpreter, 
then move all wbi files on server documentroot

-Compile CLI with make and move ELF binary to apache server documentroot too

-Give apache some permission to execute sudo, maybe add apache user to wheel group 
and configure sudo to execute without password. (can be very dangerous, do it at you'r own risk)

-Start apache server and request index.php from every device with an explorer

You can add, substract, and modify control ports in config.php, you can also modify acces password on it.



Thats all for now!! , pretty simple eh?
